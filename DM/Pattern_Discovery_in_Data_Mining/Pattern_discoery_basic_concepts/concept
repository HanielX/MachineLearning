(absolute)support is the count
(relative)support is the fraction
Association Rules X - > Y(s,c)
s is the probability that a transaction contain X union Y
c  is conditional probability that a transaction contains X also contains Y

closed pattern : A pattern X is closed if X is frequent,and there is no super-pattern Y > X with the same support as X
closed pattern is a losses compression of frequent patterns
max-pattern : A pattern X is closed if X is frequent,and there is no super-pattern Y > X
closed pattern is a lossy compression
